<p>
  Congratulations on your new tattoo! From here, your job is to take great care of your tattoo so that your tattoo will
  look just as good when it has healed. The initial healing/peeling process can generally take anywhere from a week and
  a half to two weeks, and it can take up to a month and a half for the tattoo to fully settle into the skin. During the
  initial healing period, your tattoo will go from being raw, open skin, to developing a crispy layer over the top which
  will then flake and peel, revealing your healed tattoo. Your tattoo will then take a little while longer to "settle
  in", and during that time may look a bit dry or shiny in places. This is totally normal.
</p>
<p>
  If your artist used a Saniderm/Derm-Shield type bandage, you may leave the bandage on for 3-5 days (it is okay to take
  it off earlier, too). The bandage is waterproof and you can shower with it on. Please note that the day after your
  appointment, the tattoo may start to look inky/fuzzy/messy under the bandage. This is totally normal! It is caused by
  fluid coming from the tattoo (a mix of plasma, ink, and blood) and it will not hurt your tattoo.
</p>

<h2 id="remove-early">When to remove the bandage early</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you have irritation, redness, or itching around the edges of the bandage
  </li>
  <li>
    If the bandage has sprung a leak
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="removal">When removing the bandage</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Take the bandage off in the shower. Peel it off slowly in the direction of hair growth allowing water to run under
    the bandage as you pull.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tattoo-care">Caring for your tattoo after the bandage comes off</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Wash the tattoo with unscented liquid soap (Dial Gold is great, or other liquid/unscented soap. No bar soap!).
  </li>
  <li>
    Pat your tattoo dry with a clean paper towel. Avoid using fabric towels if possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow your tattoo to air out for a few minutes (this is important to make sure your tattoo is not holding excess
    moisture from the shower, especially once it begins to peel).
  </li>
  <li>
    Gently pat a small amount of unscented lotion into your tattoo. Some good lotion brands are Lubriderm, Curel,
    Aveeno, Vaseline Intensive Care (but not Vaseline!), Cetaphil, and Cerave.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can reapply the lotion as needed throughout the day. Some people put it on just in the morning and at night, and
    some people apply more often- whenever the tattoo feels dry or itchy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure the lotion has soaked in and your skin is dry to the touch before putting on clothing that may cover the
    tattoo.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-to-avoid">Things to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Petroleum-Based Ointments: things like Aquaphor, A&D, Vaseline, Neosporin, etc. All of these formulations are very
    heavy and it can be easy to accidentally over-apply them. You risk causing heavy scabbing and possible
    scarring/pigment loss if you overdo it!
  </li>
  <li>
    No soaking the tattoo until it has completely peeled. A quick shower is fine, but no baths, ocean. pool/jacuzzi
    until healing is complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid direct sun exposure during the healing process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be mindful not to let your healing tattoo come in contact with things like gym equipment, exercise mats, or other
    unsanitized surfaces. It is possible to contract infections (Staph, MRSA, etc) from places like gyms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not use a washcloth on the tattoo area until it has fully healed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="important">Important</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you have any questions at ANY point during the healing process (no matter how silly the question may seem),
    please contact your artist. They are here to help, and they can answer any questions you may have.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your tattoo develops any major swelling, oozing, pussing, feels hot to the touch, etc, please check in with a
    doctor or medical professional for advice. Please also check in with your tattoo artist to let them know, but it is
    important to also seek medical care.
  </li>
</ul>
